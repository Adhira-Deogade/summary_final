' financial research group __markit__ yesterday said its index of activity in the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of uk output - rose from __60.3__ in september to __62.5__ in october . that was the strongest reading since may 1997 , the month when tony blair became prime minister , and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from decline . __markit__ said that combined with strong reports on manufacturing and construction , october was the best month for the uk economy since the start of 1998 . push : the strong growth could force the bank of england -lrb- pictured -rrb- to raise interest rates sooner than expected in what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but relief to britain 's army of savers . david noble , chief executive at the chartered institute of purchasing and supply , which compiles the report with __markit__ , hailed ` a sparkling start ' to the fourth quarter of the year . chris williamson , chief economist at __markit__ , said it put the uk on course for growth of 1.3 per cent in the final three months of 2013 . but others were even more upbeat , with forecasting group capital economics and european banking giant ing predicting growth of as much as 1.5 per cent between october and december . the ec predicted growth of 1.3 per cent in the uk this year followed by 2.2 per cent in 2014 and 2.4 per cent in 2015 - outstripping germany , france , italy and spain , the four biggest economies in the eurozone .\n",
